    \item {\textbf{High Performance Computing:} parallelised Lattice-Boltzmann codes with the OpenCL, OpenMP and MPI libraries to run on both GPUs and CPUs. All implementations were written in C. Achieved the highest grade in the class. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/HPC-OpenCL}{GitHub}.}
    \item {\textbf{Computer Architecture:} implemented a simulation of a superscalar, out-of-order processor with register renaming and dynamic branch prediction. From scratch using Python. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/Superscalar}{GitHub}.}
    \item{\textbf{Deep Learning (thesis project):} implemented and ablated the U-Net CNN architecture using Keras. It successfully extracts the density banding information present in coral skeleton CT scans, enabling researchers to more accurately calculate coral growth rates. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/Thesis}{GitHub}.}
    \item{\textbf{Deep Learning:} wrote a small deep learning library from scratch in Python enabling the creation, training, and inference of fully connected neural networks. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/tinyNet}{GitHub}.}
    \item {\textbf{Cryptography:} implemented a Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attack in Python that targets software AES implementations. Wrote an AES software implementation in C that utilises various DPA countermeasures such as ‘masking’.}
    \item {\textbf{Computer Graphics:} created a 3D rasteriser using C++ and the SDL, and GLM libraries. Implemented full triangle clipping, shadow volumes, and anti-aliasing. Also using C++, SDL, and GLM, implemented a real-time raytracer with soft shadows and anti-aliasing. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/Rasteriser}{GitHub}.}
    \item {\textbf{Web Development:} implemented the backend and frontend of \href{https://timeline.wang}{an interactive 3D timeline} using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The pseudo 3D animation uses no frameworks or libraries. Available on \href{https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/timeline.wang}{GitHub}.}
